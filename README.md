# *Snake and Ladder Game*
> ## Game Description:
   * Snakes and ladders is an ancient Indian board game that’s regarded today as a worldwide classic. It requires two or more players and takes place on a board            with numbered, gridded squares. Throughout the board, there are snakes and ladders which connect different squares. Players roll a dice and navigate on the board.
   
> ## Purpose from this project:
   * using data structures and algorithms to make non-simple game and calculating time complexity in different conditions,we implemented      game with c++ language        with **_data structure_** concept, and use **SFML** library to make game more user friendly. 
   
> ## Contents:
   * _snake and ladder image_ -->( 30 squares )
   * _OpenSans-SemiBoldItalic_ --> ( italic font ) 
   * _game files_   ( for game graphics)  -->header & cpp files
   * _button files_ ( for making buttons to cotrol rolling the dice of player 1 (user) )  -->header & cpp files
   * _list files_   ( for game algorithm)  -->header & cpp files
   * _node files_   ( for representing the squares in the game )  -->header & cpp files
   * _main file_    ( using all files for the game execution )
   
> ## Setup and running settings:
   * Download `SFML` library from:
        * [download SFML library 2.5.1](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/)
        * [SFML configuration with Visual Studio](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-vc.php)
       
  * Download all project files 
  * After creation of new project in VS and making all settings on it, add all project file from your project options.
  * change paths of photos and font file to your path, In changing to your paths please use / instead of \\. 
    * In lines 14, 16, 180, 182 (in Game.cpp file)

  * we made two options to play
    *    play using 30 square
    *    palying using 100 square 
  * you need only to change between 30 and 100 in the shown places in 2 files (**_main.cpp & game.h_**)
