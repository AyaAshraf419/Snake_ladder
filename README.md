> ### Game Description:
   * Snakes and ladders is an ancient Indian board game thatâ€™s regarded today as a worldwide classic.

Players roll a dice and navigate on the board.
   
> ### Purpose from this project:
   * using data structures and algorithms to make non-simple game and calculating time complexity in different conditions,we implemented      game with c++ language        with **_data structure_** concept, and use **SFML** library to make game more user friendly.

> ### setup and running settings:
   * Download `SFML` library from:
        * [download SFML library 2.5.1](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/)
        * [SFML Configuration with Visual Studio](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-vc.php)
       
  * Download all project files 
  * After creation of new project in VS and making all settings on it :
            * Add all project file from your project options.
  * Now,run the game and enjoy  ^_^
